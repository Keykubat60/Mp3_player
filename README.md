# **MP3_player**



The project is a MP3Player and written only in Java. I did everything myself. 
The application looks modern and compact. 
It has the following properties: forward, backward, pause, play, loop. 
You choose the music list yourself and just let it play. In my example, only (.mp3) formats work.
